# BandWebsite

A band's website template with a description, a page to listen tracks and finally, a link tree to share all of the band's links! Translated in FR, EN, ES, DE.

When cloned, you need to perform several operations so the website is fully customized to your need :

- fill HTML files, mostly for title and description (head tag) ;
- replace the band logo and the favicons\* in `assets/img/` ;
- fill `assets/audio/` with mp3 extracts of the releases you want to make available to listeners ;
- fill `assets/img/releases/` with releases' artworks ;
- fill the `assets/json/{lang}.json` with the band information ;
- fill the `assets/json/band.json` with artist links and releases\*\* ;
- create your custom `index.html` file so it reflect the band's will ;
- build assets using `npm install && npm run build`.

\* Favicon can be generated using a website such as [https://www.favicon-generator.org/](https://www.favicon-generator.org/)).

\*\* In the JSON files ; in links, you can erase links that are not relevant for the band. In the releases, links/moreLinks urls should be empty but don't erase them. In the tracks, composer or author can be empty (and will not be displayed) 

Supported links to be displayed :
Facebook, YouTube, Spotify, Apple Music, Deezer, Amazon Music, Tidal, SoundCloud, Bandcamp, Discogs, Genius, MusicBrainz
